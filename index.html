				<h2> About the Gardener </h2>
				<p> Welcome to my shrine to my house plant collection, including tips, tricks, and mistakes to avoid from my experience with indoor growing. I have 12 (and counting) plants occupying my 600 square ft college apartment. I learned everything I know thus far about plants and gardening from my Aunt Steph, who has the brightest green thumb of anyone I know. I am still experimenting with new plants and growth techniques. Enter my indoor jungle and learn to cultivate your own! </p>
