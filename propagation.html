		<h1> <b> Propagation Station </b> </h1>
			<p> Propagation is an easy and useful growth method that can successfully be done indoors! Propagation is when a cutting is taken off of a currently growing parent plant and placed in water or soil to become a new plant. It is so much fun to see these baby plants grow roots and flourish! Many of your favorite fresh herbs from the grocery store can be propagated for use in the kitchen as well. </p>
		<h2> Propagating a Philodendron </h2>
			<p> I recently had major success propagating my overgrown philodendron. It is one of the most adaptable house plants, making it very easy to propagate. Follow these simple steps to grow your own baby philodendron plant. </p>
			<ol> 
				<li> Begin by cutting a 3-4 inch piece from your parent plant, ensuring that a root node is present near the bottom of the cutting. Prune any leaves that are on the bottom half of your cutting. </li>
				<li> Next, fill a short glass (I like to use disposable shot glasses or mini jars) with clean water and put your cutting into the water. Make sure none of the remaining leaves are submerged. Also, ensure that the root node is underwater so that the roots will emerge. </li>
				<li> Now you wait for around 2-4 weeks for roots to begin to grow. During this time, change the water and rinse the roots and leaves of the plant every 3-5 days to keep the roots clean. </li>
				<li> Once your root growth is 2 inches or longer, you may transfer the propagated cutting from the water into soil and allow it to grow on its own. Water your plant every time the soil feels completely dry. Another option is to keep your philodendron in water to grow, changing the size of the vase to match the room the roots need.</li>
