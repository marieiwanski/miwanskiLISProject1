		<h2> How to Spot Root Rot </h2>
			<p> Root rot happens when your plant starts to die from the bottom up, usually due to over-soaked soil. Because the problem begins under the soil, it can be hard to spot. One early sign of root rot is weak, flimsy leaves which will then become weak stems. If you suspect root rot, take a small clipping from the plant near the bottom of the root. Inspect the root for discoloration and mushiness. A healthy root will be white and firm, while a sick root will be brown or black and mushy.

		<h2> How to Save a Plant Suffering from Root Rot </h2>
			<p> If your plant shows signs of root rot when you check your plant cutting, there are a few steps that can be taken to save the plant if it is still viable. First, take small cuttings from the bottom to the top of the stem. Continue to cut higher up until the stem is no longer brown or black inside. If the root is rotted all the way through, the entire stem vein will be discolored and the plant will not be revivable. If you find a piece of root that is firm and white, you're in luck, the plant can be resurrected! You can do so through propagation in water or soil, depending on the type of plant. Learn how to propagate your cutting on the<a href= "propagation.html">Propagation Station page</a>here.
